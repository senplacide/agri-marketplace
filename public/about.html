  <h1>About AgriConnect</h1>
  <p>AgriConnect is designed as a localized, low-bandwidth digital marketplace to specifically address core challenges faced by smallholder farmers. By facilitating direct connections between local farmers and verified buyers, the platform significantly reduces post-harvest losses that often occur due to delays and inefficient supply chains. Its optimized architecture ensures fast, reliable access even on simple feature phones, promoting digital inclusion among farming communities with limited resources. This streamlined process empowers farmers to transparently showcase their available produce, leading to fair price discovery and ultimately improving their economic resilience and market participation. The platform drives efficiency, stabilizes local food systems, and ensures better returns for producers.</p>
